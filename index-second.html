      <h1 class="lead__title">You’re at the end of the road, buddy!</h1>
      <p class="lead__subtitle">Before you go, read this motivating letter.</p>
      <details class="lead__details">
        <summary class="lead__summary">Click me!</summary>
        <p class="lead__text">The year was 2010.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">I’d just graduated from college with $97k in student loan debt, a really bad haircut, and
          no choice but to move back into my parents’ basement.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">If I could sum up that year of my life into one word, it’d be: frustration.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">There were so many things I wanted to change. I wanted to get fit, advance my filmmaking
          career, and make healthier choices instead of eating cold pizza for breakfast every day.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">But trying to close the gap between the person I was back then and the person I wanted to
          be felt paralyzing, confusing, and out of reach.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">I’m willing to bet you’ve felt the same way too.
        </p>
        <p class="lead__text">At some point, you looked around and realized you’re not living the life you envisioned
          for yourself.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">Maybe you’re stuck repeating a cycle of behaviors that you know aren’t healthy for you,
          like smoking, staying up way too late, or drinking too much.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">Or you realize you’ve been following other people’s rules, expectations, and versions of
          “success” instead of creating your own.
        </p>
        <p class="lead__text">When this happens, we have two options.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">We can continue to stay the path and hope things will get better on their own.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">Or we can take the first step to creating the life we want.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">For me, that first step was asking the question, “What would happen if I radically
          simplified my life?”</p>
        <p class="lead__text">This led me down the rabbit hole of minimalism, where I met two guys crazy enough to buy
          into my idea for a documentary. That film ended up on Netflix and eventually led me to start my YouTube
          channel. And now I’m living a life that’s more aligned with my own version of success.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">Of course, this didn’t happen overnight. There were a lot of baby steps, uphill battles,
          and failures in between…</p>
        <p class="lead__text">…but none of it would have happened if I hadn’t taken responsibility for making that very
          first step.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">So now, I want to encourage you to ask yourself the hard, but eye-opening questions:</p>
        <p class="lead__text">How satisfied are you with your life?</p>
        <p class="lead__text">What is *your* version of success?</p>
        <p class="lead__text">What do you want your life to look like one year from now?</p>
        <p class="lead__text">Tough questions, I know.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">But when you take the time to pause and reflect on them, you’ll be surprised at where they
          take you.</p>
        <p class="lead__text">To closing the gap,</p>
